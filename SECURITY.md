## 🔓 Web Worker Security Vulnerabilities

### Attack Surface

While Web Workers provide some isolation from the main thread, they are **not a secure execution environment** and should not be relied upon for protecting sensitive cryptographic material.

### Known Attack Vectors

#### 1. **Code Injection Attacks**

Any malicious code injected into your application (via XSS, supply chain attacks, browser extensions, or compromised dependencies) can:

- **Read Worker Memory**: Access the worker's global scope and extract secrets
- **Intercept Messages**: Monitor `postMessage()` communication between main thread and worker
- **Monkey-Patch APIs**: Override `crypto.subtle`, `postMessage`, or other worker APIs to exfiltrate keys
- **Timing Attacks**: Measure execution time to infer information about private keys

**Example Attack:**
```javascript
// Malicious code injected into main thread or worker
const originalPostMessage = Worker.prototype.postMessage;
Worker.prototype.postMessage = function(msg) {
  console.log('Intercepted:', msg); // Exfiltrate secrets
  sendToAttacker(msg);
  return originalPostMessage.apply(this, arguments);
};
```

#### 2. **localStorage Vulnerabilities**

The encrypted Ed25519 archive is stored in `localStorage`, which is accessible to:
- Any JavaScript running in the same origin
- Browser extensions with appropriate permissions
- Physical access to the device (local storage is not encrypted at rest)

**Even with encryption**, an attacker who can inject code can:
- Wait for the decryption key to be used
- Intercept the decrypted archive during operation
- Capture the PRF seed when WebAuthn authentication occurs

#### 3. **Memory Dumping**

An attacker with sufficient privileges (e.g., via browser vulnerability, malicious extension) could:
- Dump worker memory to extract private keys
- Access the AES-GCM encryption key while it's in use
- Read plaintext secrets during cryptographic operations

#### 4. **Supply Chain Attacks**

Dependencies used in workers (`@ucanto/principal`, `@noble/hashes`, etc.) could be compromised:
- Malicious package updates
- Typosquatting attacks
- Compromised maintainer accounts

## 🛡️ Recommended Secure Architecture: Hardware-Backed P-256 DIDs

### The Secure Approach

The **most secure architecture** for this application would be to exclusively use **P-256 DIDs with WebAuthn**, where:

✅ **Private keys never leave hardware**  
✅ **Signing operations performed in secure enclaves** (TPM, Secure Element, Trusted Execution Environment)  
✅ **No key material exposed to JavaScript**  
✅ **Biometric authentication required for each operation**  
✅ **No encrypted keystores in localStorage**  

### Why P-256 + WebAuthn is Superior

| Feature | Current (Ed25519 + Worker) | Ideal (P-256 + WebAuthn) |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Private Key Exposure** | ❌ Exists in worker memory | ✅ Never leaves hardware |
| **Attack Surface** | ❌ Large (JS injection, worker compromise) | ✅ Minimal (hardware isolation) |
| **Storage Security** | ❌ Encrypted in localStorage | ✅ No storage needed |
| **Signature Operations** | ❌ In JavaScript/WASM | ✅ In secure hardware |
| **Key Extraction** | ❌ Possible with code injection | ✅ Cryptographically impossible |
| **Biometric Gate** | ❌ One-time (for PRF seed) | ✅ Per-operation |

### Architecture Comparison

**Current Implementation (Insecure):**
```
WebAuthn (P-256) → PRF Seed → Worker AES Key → Decrypt Ed25519 Key → Sign in JS
      ↑                                                   ↑
   Hardware Secure                                   Software (Vulnerable)
```

**Ideal Implementation (Secure):**
```
WebAuthn (P-256) → Sign UCAN → Done
      ↑
   Hardware Secure (End-to-End)
```

## 🚧 Current Limitation: Storacha Doesn't Support P-256

### The Problem

Unfortunately, the [Storacha upload service](https://github.com/storacha/upload-service) currently **only supports Ed25519 signatures** for UCAN-based authentication. This forces applications to:

1. Generate Ed25519 keys in software (JavaScript)
2. Store these keys (even if encrypted)
3. Expose keys to potential extraction attacks

This architectural limitation **prevents the use of hardware-backed security** that WebAuthn/P-256 provides.

### Our Solution: P-256 Fork

We have implemented P-256 signature support in our fork of the UCAN library:

🔗 **[P-256 Implementation Fork](https://github.com/NiKrause/ucanto/tree/p256)**

This fork adds:
- P-256 signature verification
- WebAuthn-compatible signature schemes
- Hardware-backed UCAN signing

### Path to Production Security

For this application to be production-ready, the following steps are required:

1. ✅ **Complete**: P-256 support implemented in [NiKrause/ucanto](https://github.com/NiKrause/ucanto/tree/p256)
2. ⏳ **Pending**: Integrate P-256 into [storacha/upload-service](https://github.com/storacha/upload-service)
3. ⏳ **Pending**: Security audit of integration
4. ⏳ **Pending**: Deploy to production Storacha infrastructure

**Until Storacha supports P-256**, this application will continue to use the insecure Ed25519-in-worker pattern.

## 🔐 P-256 UCAN Delegation: Challenges and Reality

### The WebAuthn Signature Format Problem

While WebAuthn uses P-256 (ES256) for signatures, it doesn't sign arbitrary data directly. Instead, it creates signatures over a specific structure:

```
signature = sign_P256(authenticatorData || sha256(clientDataJSON))
```

Where `clientDataJSON` wraps your data:
```json
{
  "type": "webauthn.get",
  "challenge": "base64url(yourData)",
  "origin": "https://your-domain.com"
}
```

**This is fundamentally different from what UCAN needs:**
```
signature = sign_P256(rawUcanPayloadBytes)
```

### What P-256 Support Enables

Our [P-256 fork](https://github.com/NiKrause/ucanto/tree/p256) adds P-256 signature **verification** to ucanto, which means:

✅ Ucanto can verify P-256 signatures  
✅ Storacha could accept P-256 DIDs  
✅ UCAN tokens can use P-256 keys  

**However**, this still requires **raw P-256 signatures**, not WebAuthn-wrapped assertions.

### The Missing Piece

To achieve true hardware-backed UCAN signing, we would need:

1. **Raw P-256 signing capability** (not WebAuthn-wrapped)
2. **Hardware-backed keys** (TPM/Secure Enclave)
3. **Both simultaneously** ← This is what WebAuthn doesn't provide today

WebAuthn provides #2 but not #1. You can have hardware security **OR** raw UCAN-compatible signatures, but not both with current web standards.

### Why the Current Architecture Exists

The Ed25519-in-worker approach is a **pragmatic compromise** given:

- WebAuthn can't produce raw signatures for UCAN
- UCAN ecosystem expects standard signature formats
- Pure hardware-backed delegation isn't feasible with current web APIs
- Storacha requires working signatures today (not in 2+ years)

This architectural limitation is **not a design flaw** but rather **the reality of current web cryptography standards**.

### Future Possibilities

True hardware-backed P-256 UCAN delegation would require:

1. **WebAuthn Level 3+** with raw signing capabilities (not currently standardized)
2. **Platform-specific APIs** (Apple CryptoKit, Windows CNG) outside the browser
3. **Native applications** with direct hardware access (defeats the browser-only goal)

**Timeline**: Any web standard solution is likely 2-5 years away, if it happens at all.

## 🔒 Mitigation Strategies (Current Architecture)

While the current architecture is insecure, the following measures reduce (but do not eliminate) risk:

### 0. Use in Restricted Environments

**Most Important**: To significantly reduce the attack surface:

- ✅ **Use in browsers WITHOUT any extensions** (e.g., Chrome/Firefox with zero extensions installed)
- ✅ **Use on mobile phones** where browser extensions are typically not available and the attack surface is much smaller
- ❌ **Avoid using with browser extensions installed** - they can inject code, intercept messages, and access localStorage

This single measure eliminates many of the code injection attack vectors described in this document.

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" 
      content="default-src 'self'; 
               script-src 'self'; 
               worker-src 'self'; 
               connect-src 'self' https://up.storacha.network;">
```

### 2. Subresource Integrity (SRI)
Use SRI tags for all external scripts:
```html
<script src="..." integrity="sha384-..." crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

### 3. Dependency Pinning
Lock all dependencies to specific versions and audit regularly:
```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

### 4. Short-Lived Sessions
- Clear worker memory after operations
- Re-authenticate frequently
- Don't persist decrypted keys

### 5. User Education
Warn users that:
- This is not production-grade security
- Private keys may be exposed to malicious code
- Only use for testing with non-critical data
