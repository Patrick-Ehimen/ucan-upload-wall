## 🔓 Web Worker Security Vulnerabilities

### Attack Surface

While Web Workers provide some isolation from the main thread, they are **not a secure execution environment** and should not be relied upon for protecting sensitive cryptographic material.

### Known Attack Vectors

#### 1. **Code Injection Attacks**

Any malicious code injected into your application (via XSS, supply chain attacks, browser extensions, or compromised dependencies) can:

- **Read Worker Memory**: Access the worker's global scope and extract secrets
- **Intercept Messages**: Monitor `postMessage()` communication between main thread and worker
- **Monkey-Patch APIs**: Override `crypto.subtle`, `postMessage`, or other worker APIs to exfiltrate keys
- **Timing Attacks**: Measure execution time to infer information about private keys

**Example Attack:**
```javascript
// Malicious code injected into main thread or worker
const originalPostMessage = Worker.prototype.postMessage;
Worker.prototype.postMessage = function(msg) {
  console.log('Intercepted:', msg); // Exfiltrate secrets
  sendToAttacker(msg);
  return originalPostMessage.apply(this, arguments);
};
```

#### 2. **localStorage Vulnerabilities**

The encrypted Ed25519 archive is stored in `localStorage`, which is accessible to:
- Any JavaScript running in the same origin
- Browser extensions with appropriate permissions

**Even with encryption**, an attacker who can inject code can:
- Wait for the decryption key to be used
- Intercept the decrypted archive during operation
- Capture the PRF seed when WebAuthn authentication occurs

#### 3. **Memory Dumping**

An attacker with sufficient privileges (e.g., via browser vulnerability, malicious extension) could:
- Dump worker memory to extract private keys
- Access the AES-GCM encryption key while it's in use
- Read plaintext secrets during cryptographic operations

#### 4. **Supply Chain Attacks**

Dependencies used in workers (`@ucanto/principal`, `@noble/hashes`, etc.) could be compromised:
- Malicious package updates
- Typosquatting attacks
- Compromised maintainer accounts

## 🛡️ Recommended Secure Architecture: Hardware-Backed WebAuthn Keys

### The Ideal Approach

The **most secure architecture** for this application would be to exclusively use **hardware-backed WebAuthn keys** (P-256 or Ed25519), where:

✅ **Private keys never leave hardware**  
✅ **Signing operations performed in secure enclaves** (TPM, Secure Element, Trusted Execution Environment)  
✅ **No key material exposed to JavaScript**  
✅ **Biometric authentication required for each operation**  
✅ **No encrypted keystores in localStorage**  

### Why Hardware-Backed WebAuthn is Superior

| Feature | Current (Ed25519 + Worker) | Ideal (WebAuthn Hardware Keys) |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Private Key Exposure** | ❌ Exists in worker memory | ✅ Never leaves hardware |
| **Attack Surface** | ❌ Large (JS injection, worker compromise) | ✅ Minimal (hardware isolation) |
| **Storage Security** | ❌ Encrypted in localStorage | ✅ No storage needed |
| **Signature Operations** | ❌ In JavaScript/WASM | ✅ In secure hardware |
| **Key Extraction** | ❌ Possible with code injection | ✅ Cryptographically impossible |
| **Biometric Gate** | ❌ One-time (for PRF seed) | ✅ Per-operation |

### Architecture Comparison

**Current Implementation (Insecure):**
```
WebAuthn (P-256) → PRF Seed → Worker AES Key → Decrypt Ed25519 Key → Sign in JS
      ↑                                                   ↑
   Hardware Secure                                   Software (Vulnerable)
```

**Ideal Implementation (If Possible):**
```
WebAuthn (P-256 or Ed25519) → Sign UCAN → Done
      ↑
   Hardware Secure (End-to-End)
```

However, this ideal implementation **is not possible** with current web standards (see next section).

## 🚧 Current Limitation: WebAuthn Signature Format Incompatibility

### Why P-256 Support Doesn't Solve This

While P-256 signature **verification** support has been explored (see [experimental fork](https://github.com/NiKrause/ucanto/tree/p256)), adding P-256 to ucanto/Storacha **does not solve the core WebAuthn signature format problem**:

- ❌ Still requires **raw** signatures (not WebAuthn-wrapped)
- ❌ Does not enable hardware-backed WebAuthn signing
- ❌ Application must still use software-based key generation
- ❌ Worker security vulnerability remains

**Reality Check**: P-256 and Ed25519 are both affected equally by the WebAuthn signature format incompatibility. Using P-256 instead of Ed25519 would **not** improve security - both would still require software-based keys in web workers.

## 🔐 WebAuthn UCAN Signing: Why It's Not Possible

### The WebAuthn Signature Format Problem

**WebAuthn supports both P-256 (ES256) and Ed25519 (EdDSA) algorithms**, but **neither can be used for UCAN signing** due to the WebAuthn signature format.

> **Note**: Ed25519 (EdDSA) support in WebAuthn was added in the [WebAuthn Level 3 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/) finalized in 2025. Browser and hardware support is still rolling out. However, **even with Ed25519 support, the WebAuthn signature format limitation remains** - you still cannot produce raw Ed25519 signatures for UCAN signing.

According to the **[W3C WebAuthn Level 3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/)**, WebAuthn doesn't sign arbitrary data directly. Instead, it creates signatures over a specific structure (§6.5.5):

```
signature = sign(authenticatorData || sha256(clientDataJSON))
```

Where `clientDataJSON` wraps your data (§6.5):
```json
{
  "type": "webauthn.get",
  "challenge": "base64url(yourData)",
  "origin": "https://your-domain.com",
  "crossOrigin": false
}
```

**This is fundamentally incompatible with what UCAN requires:**
```
signature = sign(rawUcanPayloadBytes)
```

This limitation applies **equally to P-256 AND Ed25519** keys in WebAuthn - the problem is not the cryptographic algorithm, but the signature format specification.

### The Missing Piece

To achieve true hardware-backed UCAN signing, we would need:

1. **Raw signature capability** (not WebAuthn-wrapped) - **Missing**
2. **Hardware-backed keys** (TPM/Secure Enclave) - **✅ Available via WebAuthn**
3. **Both simultaneously** ← This is what WebAuthn doesn't provide today

WebAuthn provides #2 but not #1. You can have hardware security **OR** raw UCAN-compatible signatures, but not both with current web standards.

This limitation applies equally to:
- ❌ WebAuthn P-256 keys
- ❌ WebAuthn Ed25519 keys  
- ❌ WebCrypto API P-256 keys (not hardware-backed)
- ❌ WebCrypto API Ed25519 keys (not hardware-backed)

### Why the Current Architecture Exists

The Ed25519-in-worker approach is a **pragmatic compromise** given the constraints:

1. **WebAuthn Limitation**: Neither P-256 nor Ed25519 keys in WebAuthn can produce raw signatures for UCAN
2. **UCAN Ecosystem**: Expects standard signature formats (raw ECDSA/EdDSA), not WebAuthn-wrapped assertions
3. **Storacha Requirement**: Only accepts Ed25519 signatures
4. **Browser-Only Goal**: Must work entirely in browser without native applications
5. **Immediate Functionality**: Requires working signatures today, not in 2-5 years

This architectural limitation is **not a design flaw** but rather **the reality of current web cryptography standards**.

### WebAuthn Specification References

The signature format limitation is defined in:

- **[WebAuthn Level 3 § 6.5.5](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/#sctn-op-get-assertion)** - Generating an Authentication Assertion
- **[WebAuthn Level 3 § 6.5](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/#dictdef-collectedclientdata)** - CollectedClientData Structure

Key points from the specification:

> "Let signature be the assertion signature of the concatenation `authenticatorData || hash`..."

Where `hash = SHA-256(UTF-8 encoding of clientDataJSON)`, and `clientDataJSON` is origin-bound.

This means:
- ❌ Signatures cannot be verified independently of the web origin
- ❌ Signatures include ceremony type (`webauthn.get` vs `webauthn.create`)
- ❌ Data is double-hashed (challenge → clientDataJSON → SHA-256 → signed)
- ❌ No "raw signing mode" exists in WebAuthn Level 3

### Future Possibilities

True hardware-backed UCAN signing would require **one of these approaches**:

1. **WebAuthn Extension** for raw signing (not proposed for Level 3+)
2. **New Web Standard** for hardware-backed cryptographic operations
3. **Platform-specific APIs** (Apple CryptoKit, Windows CNG) outside the browser
4. **Native applications** with direct hardware access (defeats browser-only goal)
5. **Custom UCAN Verifier** accepting WebAuthn signature format (breaks ecosystem compatibility)

**Timeline**: Any web standard solution is likely 2-5 years away, if it happens at all.

**Workaround Used**: Generate Ed25519 keys in software (web worker), derive encryption key from WebAuthn PRF, encrypt and store keys. This provides WebAuthn-gated access to Ed25519 keys but **does not** provide hardware-backed key security.

## 🔮 Future Solution: Multi-Device Distributed Key Generation

While the WebAuthn signature format limitation cannot be solved with current standards, there is a **long-term solution** that eliminates the web worker security vulnerability entirely: **Distributed Key Generation (DKG)** with threshold cryptography.

### The Concept

Instead of storing a complete Ed25519 key on a single device (vulnerable to extraction), **split the key across multiple devices**:

```
Device 1 (Browser)     Device 2 (Mobile)
      ↓                       ↓
  Key Share 1            Key Share 2
  (hardware-backed)      (hardware-backed)
      ↓                       ↓
      └─────────┬─────────────┘
                ↓
         Combined Signature
         (BOTH devices required)
```

### How It Solves the Security Problem

**Key Security Benefits:**

- ✅ **No complete key on any device** - compromising one device doesn't expose the private key
- ✅ **Multi-device authentication** - requires biometric approval on both devices for signing
- ✅ **Hardware-backed shares** - each key share protected by WebAuthn on its device
- ✅ **No key material in JavaScript** - only combined during threshold signing protocol
- ✅ **Eliminates worker vulnerability** - no complete key exists in web worker memory

**Attack Mitigation:**

| Attack Vector | Current (Ed25519 in Worker) | DKG (Multi-Device) |
|--------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Code Injection | ❌ Can steal complete key | ✅ Only gets one share (useless alone) |
| Worker Compromise | ❌ Full key exposed | ✅ Incomplete key share |
| Lost/Stolen Device | ❌ Full key compromised | ✅ Requires both devices |
| Memory Dumping | ❌ Can extract full key | ✅ Only partial key share |

### Implementation Status

This is a **Phase 2 long-term goal** (12-24 months). For full technical details including:
- Threshold signature protocols (FROST)
- Device communication (js-libp2p)
- QR code signing flow
- Cross-device authentication

## 🔒 Mitigation Strategies (Current Architecture)

While the current architecture is insecure, the following measures reduce (but do not eliminate) risk:

### 0. Use in Restricted Environments

**Most Important**: To significantly reduce the attack surface:

- ✅ **Use in browsers WITHOUT any extensions** (e.g., Chrome/Firefox with zero extensions installed)
- ✅ **Use on mobile phones** where browser extensions are typically not available and the attack surface is much smaller
- ❌ **Avoid using with browser extensions installed** - they can inject code, intercept messages, and access localStorage

This single measure eliminates many of the code injection attack vectors described in this document.

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" 
      content="default-src 'self'; 
               script-src 'self'; 
               worker-src 'self'; 
               connect-src 'self' https://up.storacha.network;">
```

### 2. Subresource Integrity (SRI)
Use SRI tags for all external scripts:
```html
<script src="..." integrity="sha384-..." crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

### 3. Dependency Pinning
Lock all dependencies to specific versions and audit regularly:
```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

### 4. Short-Lived Sessions
- Clear worker memory after operations
- Re-authenticate frequently
- Don't persist decrypted keys

### 5. User Education
Warn users that:
- This is not production-grade security
- Private keys may be exposed to malicious code
- Only use for testing with non-critical data
